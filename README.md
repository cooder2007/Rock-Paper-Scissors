# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This project is a clean and fast Rock Paper Scissors game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features smooth animations, a neon-styled interface, and a live scoreboard that updates each round. I built it to practice simple game logic and UI design while keeping the experience fun and minimal.
